# Credit Risk Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
For this analysis, a dataset from LendingClub was used to sample data using multiple machine learning models to assess
which model best predicts credit risk. This was done by using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries
in Python. Algorithms used from those libraries include *RandomOverSampler*, *SMOTE*, *ClusterCentroids*, *SMOTEENN*,
*BalancedRandomForestClassifier*, and *EasyEnsembleClassifier*. </br>
