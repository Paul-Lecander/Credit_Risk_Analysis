# Credit Risk Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
For this analysis, a dataset from LendingClub was used to sample data using multiple machine learning models to assess
which model best predicts credit risk. This was done by using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries
in Python.</br> 
Two methods of machine learning were used in this analysis:</br>
1.) Resample - takes samples from the dataset repeatedly and gives metrics based on the dataset.</br>
2.) Ensemble - takes multiple base models and combines them to give predictions.
